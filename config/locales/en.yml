# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t "hello"
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t("hello") %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   "true": "foo"
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at https://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

    To start, you can choose to Login by clicking on "Login" above or go directly to the "Visits" section and search using the search bar or by searching for the alternatives automatically proposed by the site based on your current position. <br /> In front of you will have many cards published by tourist guides with title, description, date and time. As soon as you have found the card that best suits you, you can choose to book it by pressing the "Book" button at the bottom right of the card. <br /> You will be offered two types of price: the total price not yet divided by the number of components and an estimate of the price to pay if the visit reaches the maximum number of tourists. <br /> If you are the first to book, you can choose to have the service offered privately, completely covering the cost, which can be divided according to whether you are alone or in company! <br /> Otherwise you will be able to get to know the estimated price which could undergo small positive or negative variations depending on the availability of the group. <br /> Payment will be made only one day before the visit, within which limit it will no longer be possible to cancel the reservation. If, on the other hand, you are booking for the day itself, then you are sure you want to embark on your journey! So what are you waiting for to get started?
